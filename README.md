BEGradle
===========

Extension to [ForgeGradle](http://github.com/MinecraftForge/ForgeGradle) that provides a way to build base edits and other mods that need to override vanilla source, since (although not recommended) it is still sometimes necessary...

Additionally, it provides the ability to add secondary SRGs.

**NOTE**: This is currently in an experimental phase.  The layout, behavior, and even name of the plugin has not been finalized.

This repository also includes a tweaked version of Sponge's [LaunchWrapperTestSuite](https://github.com/SpongePowered/LaunchWrapperTestSuite), from [this pull request](https://github.com/SpongePowered/LaunchWrapperTestSuite/pull/3).
